# Traffic-Sign-Image-Classification
Training of Feed-forward and Convolutional neural networks with python to classify traffic sign images using Keras and Tensorflow. **Subject**: Deep Learning. **Programme**: Master's degree in Data Science. **Data used**: http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/ . **Models**: Inception, Xception.

Work developed during the different deadlines of the Deep Learning course assignments, Unit 3, at Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.

The first assignment is an example of a deep neural network related to house pricing.

The second assignment is divided in 4 parts. Assignments goals:

  - Assignment 1: Develop a **feed-forward** neural network to classify images that represents traffic signals.
  - Assignment 2: Improve the results, by developing a **convolutional neural network** from
scratch using keras.
  - Assignment 3: Improve the results, including **transfer learning** in the model.
  - Assignment 4: Apply the models developed to the boxes generated by an **object recognizer** for signals detection in images. Try to **improve the results**
